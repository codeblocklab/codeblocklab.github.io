Infrastructure as Code expert with deep, production-grade experience using Terraform to provision, manage, and scale cloud infrastructure across AWS, GCP, and Azure.

<!--more-->

I design and implement infrastructure-as-code solutions using Terraform that are modular, reusable, and compliant with industry standards. My expertise spans from single-module deployments to complex, multi-cloud environments with remote state management, secure secrets handling, and robust automation workflows. Whether working with Terraform open source or integrating with Terraform Cloud/Enterprise, I bring a practical and strategic approach to IaC delivery.

I apply proven design patterns such as layered architectures, DRY configurations, and code abstraction through modules to ensure infrastructure remains scalable and maintainable. Using Terragrunt, I manage complex multi-environment deployments across dev, staging, and production, ensuring consistency, traceability, and governance across all stages of the application lifecycle. For remote state, I configure secure, locked backends using S3 with DynamoDB (AWS), GCS (GCP), or Azure Blob Storage, depending on the platform.

My experience includes integrating Terraform with CI/CD systems (e.g., Atlantis, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to enable GitOps workflows for infrastructure changes—where pull requests automatically trigger plan and apply steps, protected by approval and policy gates. I frequently combine Terraform with tools like Vault for secret injection, Sentinel or OPA for policy enforcement, and use testing frameworks such as Terratest to validate infrastructure code prior to deployment.

Security, scalability, and visibility are at the core of my IaC approach. I enforce least-privilege access via IAM and roles, implement tagging standards for cost tracking and compliance, and use infrastructure linting and validation tools to catch misconfigurations early. My work often involves multi-account setups, cross-region deployments, VPC networking, Kubernetes provisioning, and serverless infrastructure — all fully codified and version-controlled.

Beyond hands-on implementation, I lead Terraform codebase architecture reviews, create reusable module libraries, define governance policies for infrastructure automation, and help organizations transition from manual provisioning to fully automated, audit-compliant IaC practices. I also advise on infrastructure standardization, naming conventions, and team workflows to improve collaboration, scalability, and onboarding.

Whether building from scratch or refactoring legacy infrastructure, I approach Terraform as both an engineering discipline and an enabler of cloud maturity, ensuring that infrastructure is no longer a bottleneck, but a core pillar of agile, reliable delivery.
