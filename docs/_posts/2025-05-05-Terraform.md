Experienced in using Terraform to automate infrastructure provisioning across cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, and Azure. Skilled in writing modular, reusable code using HCL and managing remote backends with state locking and versioning. Used Terraform Cloud and Git-based workflows to collaborate on infrastructure changes. Iâ€™ve implemented environment-specific configurations using workspaces and variables. My experience also includes integrating Terraform into CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.
