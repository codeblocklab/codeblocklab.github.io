Windows Server administration covers services such as Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, File Services, and Remote Desktop Services across physical, virtual, and cloud-hosted environments. It plays a foundational role in authentication, access control, and networked resource management.

This skillset includes provisioning and maintaining domain controllers, configuring GPOs for security and policy enforcement, managing user and computer objects in AD, and automating tasks with PowerShell. Also involves patch management, monitoring system health, and troubleshooting OS-level or network-related issues.

Covers storage configuration (e.g., NTFS, ReFS, Storage Spaces), role-based access, Windows Firewall policies, certificate services, and backup/restore strategies using native tools like Windows Admin Center, Server Manager, and WSUS.

Integrates with virtualization platforms (e.g., Hyper-V), cloud services (e.g., Azure AD, hybrid join), and monitoring solutions (e.g., SCOM, Event Viewer, PerfMon) to support high availability, disaster recovery, and compliance.

By maintaining secure, reliable Windows Server environments, this skillset ensures operational continuity, centralized identity governance, and seamless integration with enterprise applications and services.
