GitOps deployment with ArgoCD for EKS and GKE, enabling secure, declarative app delivery from Git.

<!--more-->

We deliver GitOps-based deployment automation using ArgoCD for Kubernetes environments running on AWS EKS and Google Cloud GKE. Our solution ensures declarative, auditable, and secure application delivery pipelines directly driven from Git repositories.

## Scope of the Solution

### GitOps Architecture Design

- Implementation of a Git-centric deployment model where Git is the single source of truth for infrastructure and application manifests.  
- Design of repository structure (mono vs. multi-repo), environments, and branching strategies for GitOps workflows.  
- ArgoCD setup with RBAC, project scoping, and sync policies (manual/auto/prune).

### Platform Integration (EKS + GKE)

- Deployment of ArgoCD in Kubernetes clusters on both AWS (EKS) and GCP (GKE).  
- Secure access configuration with integration to cloud IAM and OIDC providers.  
- Syncing Kubernetes resources managed via Helm, Kustomize, or plain manifests.

### Automation & CI/CD Integration

- Integration with CI pipelines to validate and push changes to Git repos (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).  
- Use of ArgoCD ApplicationSets for dynamic environment provisioning (e.g., per branch or team).  
- Implementation of automated rollbacks, drift detection, and visual diffing.

## Benefits

- Full traceability and rollback capabilities via Git  
- Consistent, automated deployments across AWS and GCP Kubernetes clusters  
- Improved security posture through declarative and auditable change management  
- Faster release cycles and simplified multi-environment coordination

## Technologies Used

- ArgoCD  
- Kubernetes (EKS, GKE)  
- GitHub / GitLab
