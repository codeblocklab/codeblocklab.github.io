<!--more-->
 
We deploy and manage SonarQube as a microservice within Kubernetes, exposing it as a shared code quality analysis engine for CI/CD pipelines. Integrated with Argo Workflows or ArgoCD, this setup allows automated static code analysis as part of every build, ensuring code health, security, and compliance.

## Scope of the Solution

### SonarQube Deployment
- Helm-based deployment of SonarQube in a Kubernetes cluster with horizontal scaling and persistent storage.  
- Use of ingress, TLS, and resource limits to ensure secure and stable operation.  
- Optional PostgreSQL setup via Helm or external managed DB (e.g., RDS or Cloud SQL).

### Argo Integration (CI Pipelines)
- Integration of SonarQube scans as steps in Argo Workflows pipelines.  
- Use of the SonarScanner CLI in isolated containers for each pipeline run.  
- Automated passing of authentication tokens, project keys, and context data.

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Support for multi-team or multi-project usage with isolated project scopes and access tokens.  
- Automated project creation and permission handling via SonarQube APIs.  
- Namespace-based separation of pipeline clients if needed.

### Observability & Quality Gates
- Use of SonarQube Quality Gates to control promotion of builds (e.g., fail workflow if quality thresholds are not met).  
- Metrics exposure for Prometheus and dashboards via Grafana.  
- Notification integration (Slack, email) on scan results or failed quality gates.

### Security & Governance
- Enforced scan policies for all pull requests and main branch merges.  
- Audit trails of scan history per commit and project.  
- Secrets (SonarQube tokens) managed via Vault or cloud secret managers.

## Benefits
- Continuous, automated code quality and security scanning across all pipelines  
- Seamless integration with GitOps-native tooling like Argo Workflows  
- Scalable, centralized SonarQube service with multi-project support  
- Improved code hygiene and early detection of bugs, code smells, and vulnerabilities
