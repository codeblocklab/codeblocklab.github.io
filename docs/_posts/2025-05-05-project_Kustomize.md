Declarative app deployment with Kustomize using environment-specific overlays instead of templating

<!--more-->
 
We implement application deployment pipelines using Kustomize as a lightweight and declarative alternative to tools like Helm. Kustomize allows environment-specific configuration using overlays, enabling clear separation of base resources and environment-level customizations (e.g., dev, staging, prod) without template logic.

## Scope of the Solution

### Kustomize Structure Design
- Definition of a modular directory layout: `base/` for common resources and `overlays/` for environment-specific adjustments.  
- Use of `kustomization.yaml` files to manage patches, image tags, resources, and configuration variants.  
- Support for secrets and config maps management using generators and transformers.

### Environment-Specific Overlays
- Separate overlays per environment (dev, test, staging, prod) with custom labels, annotations, and resource overrides.  
- Dynamic configuration for different replicas, ingress settings, resource limits, and external service endpoints.  
- Secure handling of environment-specific secrets via integrations with Sealed Secrets, SOPS, or Vault.

### CI/CD Integration
- Integration of Kustomize into GitOps workflows with ArgoCD, Flux, or CI pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).  
- Automated deployments per branch or tag using environment-mapped overlays.  
- Pull request previews or ephemeral environments using preview overlays.

### Observability & Governance
- Validation of manifests before deployment using tools like `kubeval`, `kustomize build --validate`, or `conftest`.  
- Promotion flows from lower to higher environments using Git-based change control.  
- Audit-friendly tracking of configuration changes per environment.

## Benefits
- Simple, template-free configuration management for Kubernetes deployments  
- Clear separation between shared resources and environment-specific differences  
- Easily integrated into GitOps workflows and CI/CD pipelines  
- Improved maintainability and version control of Kubernetes manifests
