Secure, serverless app deployment on AWS with WAF, ALB, ECS Fargate, and Secrets Manager.

<!--more-->
 
We deliver a secure and scalable containerized application deployment architecture using **AWS WAF**, **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, **ECS Fargate**, and **Secrets Manager**. This solution provides a fully managed, serverless infrastructure for running container workloads behind a protected and observable public interface.

## Scope of the Solution

### ECS Fargate for Serverless Containers
- Deployment of containerized applications using ECS Fargate with no need to manage EC2 instances.  
- Task definitions configured with environment variables, IAM roles, CPU/memory limits, and health checks.  
- Integration with ECR for image pulling and CloudWatch Logs for container logging.

### Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- ALB provisioned for HTTP/HTTPS traffic routing to ECS Fargate services.  
- Listener rules for routing by path, hostname, or other header-based logic.  
- HTTPS termination with certificates from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

### AWS WAF Integration
- AWS WAF deployed in front of ALB to protect against common web threats (e.g., SQLi, XSS, bots).  
- Configurable rulesets (managed or custom), IP restrictions, and rate-based protection.  
- Logging and metrics streamed to CloudWatch or S3 for security audits.

### Secrets Management
- Secure storage of credentials, API keys, and other sensitive data in AWS Secrets Manager.  
- Injection of secrets into ECS tasks via task IAM roles or environment variables.  
- Secrets versioning, rotation policies, and access logging via AWS CloudTrail.

### Infrastructure as Code & Automation
- Full provisioning with Terraform modules for ECS, ALB, WAF, and Secrets Manager.  
- Optional use of Terragrunt for multi-environment support (dev/stage/prod).  
- CI/CD pipeline integration for build, deploy, and secure parameter injection.

## Benefits
- Fully serverless and scalable container deployment with built-in security layers  
- Simplified operations with no server maintenance  
- Secure secrets handling and strict IAM control  
- Protection against web-based attacks via AWS WAF  
- Automated and reproducible setup with Infrastructure as Code
