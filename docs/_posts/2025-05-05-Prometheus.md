Enables scalable, multidimensional monitoring and alerting for modern infrastructure by collecting time-series metrics through a pull-based model and powerful query language (PromQL).

Prometheus scrapes metrics from configured targets at specified intervals, stores them locally, and provides real-time querying and alerting capabilities. It is designed for reliability and simplicity, making it a core component of cloud-native observability stacksâ€”especially when paired with Grafana, Alertmanager, and exporters.

This skillset includes configuring Prometheus servers, writing custom PromQL queries, defining alerting rules, and managing scrape targets and service discovery using static configs or dynamic sources (e.g., Kubernetes, Consul, EC2). Also involves tuning retention, federation, and remote write/read for long-term storage and multi-cluster visibility.

Covers integration with exporters for system-level metrics (Node Exporter, Blackbox Exporter), application-level instrumentation via client libraries (Go, Python, Java), and custom metric exposure in microservices and batch jobs.

Alerting is managed through Alertmanager, supporting silencing, deduplication, grouping, and routing alerts to tools like Slack, PagerDuty, Microsoft Teams, or Opsgenie.

Prometheus is widely adopted in Kubernetes environments for cluster monitoring, pod-level metrics, SLO enforcement, and autoscaling decisions via custom or HPA-integrated metrics.

By enabling high-resolution, low-overhead telemetry and flexible querying, Prometheus empowers teams to detect issues early, optimize performance, and maintain visibility across distributed systems.
