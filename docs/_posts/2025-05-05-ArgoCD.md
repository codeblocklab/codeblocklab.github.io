Experienced in using ArgoCD to implement GitOps-based continuous delivery in Kubernetes environments. Proficient in managing Kubernetes deployments by syncing Git repositories with live cluster states. I’ve set up ArgoCD projects, apps, and RBAC to support secure, multi-tenant environments. Used ArgoCD with tools like Kustomize and Helm for flexible deployments. Also skilled in troubleshooting sync errors, implementing automatic rollbacks, and monitoring application health directly through ArgoCD’s UI and API.
