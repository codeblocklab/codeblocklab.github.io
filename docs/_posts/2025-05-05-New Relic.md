Provides full-stack observability by collecting and analyzing telemetry data—metrics, logs, traces, and events—to monitor application performance, user experience, and infrastructure health in real time.

New Relic supports instrumenting cloud-native and legacy systems using agents, open telemetry, and integrations with AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, and serverless platforms. It enables deep visibility into application internals via distributed tracing, APM, browser monitoring, mobile analytics, and synthetics.

This skillset includes configuring dashboards, alert conditions, service maps, and SLO-based indicators to proactively detect anomalies and degradation. Involves managing custom events, log pipelines, and span analytics to accelerate root cause analysis and improve incident response.

New Relic’s unified UI and programmable query language (NRQL) allow teams to correlate telemetry across services, identify performance bottlenecks, and observe business-impacting behaviors in real time. Alerting integrations include Slack, PagerDuty, Microsoft Teams, and custom webhooks for operational workflows.

Used for performance optimization, error tracking, infrastructure monitoring, and SLA enforcement across microservices, APIs, containers, and edge services. New Relic also supports security monitoring, anomaly detection, and automated baselining to enhance reliability and compliance.

By consolidating observability data into a single platform, New Relic empowers teams to monitor proactively, resolve incidents faster, and optimize the health and performance of complex, distributed systems.
