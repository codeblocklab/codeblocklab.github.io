Proxmox expertise

<!--more-->
Experienced in managing virtual machines and containers with Proxmox. Set up and maintained KVM and LXC environments, with storage managed through ZFS and Ceph. Used Proxmox Backup Server for backups and automated tasks using API and scripts. Comfortable using Git to manage configuration changes and updates. Iâ€™ve configured high-availability clusters and network bridges to ensure minimal downtime and reliable resource management. My work also includes performance tuning of virtual environments and managing access through secure web interfaces and SSH.
