Provides an open-source virtualization platform that combines KVM-based virtual machines, LXC containers, and software-defined storage into a unified management interface for data center and edge deployments.

Proxmox VE (Virtual Environment) enables efficient resource utilization and simplified management of virtualized infrastructure through a web-based UI, CLI, and REST API. It supports high availability clustering, live migration, backup scheduling, and role-based access control across multi-node setups.

This skillset includes deploying and managing Proxmox clusters, configuring networking (bridged, VLAN, bonded), managing storage backends (ZFS, Ceph, LVM, NFS), and implementing virtual machine and container orchestration. Also covers snapshot management, replication, and integration with external backup solutions (e.g., PBS, Veeam).

Security practices include securing the web interface with TLS, configuring two-factor authentication, isolating tenants, and enforcing access control policies. Proxmox also supports cloud-init for automated provisioning and integrates with tools like Ansible and Terraform for infrastructure automation.

Used in small to mid-sized enterprises, labs, and production-grade environments, Proxmox enables hybrid virtualization strategies, cost-effective clustering, and infrastructure-as-code workflowsâ€”without vendor lock-in.

By consolidating virtualization, storage, and orchestration into one platform, Proxmox simplifies operations, reduces overhead, and enables efficient management of compute resources at scale.
