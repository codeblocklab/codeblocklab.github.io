Experienced in analyzing cloud usage patterns and implementing strategies to reduce costs across AWS, GCP, and Azure environments. Skilled in rightsizing compute resources, leveraging reserved and spot instances, and identifying idle or over-provisioned services. Iâ€™ve used native tools like AWS Cost Explorer and GCP Billing Reports, as well as third-party platforms for deeper insights. Cost-saving changes and recommendations are documented and versioned in Git for transparency and collaboration.
