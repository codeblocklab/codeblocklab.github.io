Focuses on maximizing the efficiency of cloud spend by identifying waste, rightsizing resources, and aligning infrastructure usage with business and workload requirements.

Cloud cost optimization involves continuous analysis of cloud usage patterns across compute, storage, networking, and managed services to reduce unnecessary spending without sacrificing performance or availability. Practices span across AWS, Azure, GCP, and hybrid environments.

This skillset includes implementing autoscaling, scheduling non-production workloads, rightsizing virtual machines, and leveraging pricing models such as spot instances, reserved instances, and savings plans. Also includes data lifecycle management and storage tiering to reduce long-term retention costs.

Involves use of native tools (e.g., AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management, GCP Billing Reports) and third-party platforms (e.g., CloudHealth, FinOps tools) to track usage, set budgets, forecast trends, and enforce spending policies.

Integrates cost-awareness into engineering workflows by tagging resources for accountability, visualizing cost per environment or team, and embedding financial metrics into CI/CD pipelines. Governance is enhanced through anomaly detection, alerts, and automated cleanup of unused resources.

By treating cost as an engineering concern, cloud cost optimization helps organizations achieve financial predictability, improve operational efficiency, and scale infrastructure in a sustainable, business-aligned way.
