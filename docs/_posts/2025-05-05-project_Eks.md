Automated EKS provisioning with Terraform, IRSA, OIDC, and CloudWatch for secure, observable Kubernetes on AWS.

<!--more-->
 
We provide a fully automated provisioning setup for Amazon EKS clusters using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), with secure integration of IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA), OIDC authentication, and native CloudWatch logging for observability. This solution enables production-ready, secure, and observable Kubernetes environments in AWS.

## Scope of the Solution

### EKS Cluster Provisioning
- Automated deployment of EKS clusters using Terraform with multi-AZ node groups.  
- Configuration of Kubernetes versions, networking (VPC, subnets), and scaling policies.  
- Integration with AWS EKS best practices for control plane security and workload separation.

### IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts)
- Enabling OIDC provider for EKS clusters and associating it with IAM.  
- Creating fine-grained IAM roles mapped to specific Kubernetes service accounts.  
- Securely delegating access to AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB, SQS) from workloads without using long-lived credentials.

### OIDC Integration
- Automatic setup of OIDC identity provider for the EKS cluster.  
- Use of OIDC tokens from service accounts to securely authenticate to AWS IAM roles.  
- Minimal permissions scoped per namespace or workload to follow least privilege principles.

### CloudWatch Logging
- Enabling audit, API, and application logs using `aws-for-fluent-bit` or custom log collectors.  
- Centralized logging for pods, nodes, and control plane metrics to CloudWatch Logs.  
- Log retention policies, metric filters, and alarms for critical workload monitoring.

### Automation & IaC Practices
- Use of Terraform modules and Terragrunt for environment-based provisioning.  
- GitOps-compatible CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Atlantis, GitHub Actions) to manage infrastructure changes.  
- Secure storage of state and secrets via S3 + DynamoDB and AWS Secrets Manager.

## Benefits
- Secure, production-grade Kubernetes clusters with automated IAM integration  
- Eliminates hardcoded credentials via IRSA and OIDC  
- Centralized observability with native AWS logging tools  
- Fully automated, repeatable, and auditable EKS provisioning process
