Automated CI/CD on GCP using Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, and GKE for containerized apps.

<!--more-->

We implement a fully automated CI/CD pipeline on Google Cloud for containerized applications. The solution leverages **Cloud Build** for building and testing images, **Artifact Registry** for secure image storage, and **GKE** (Google Kubernetes Engine) for running applications at scale.

## Scope of the Solution

### CI/CD Pipeline Design

- Cloud Build pipelines triggered by Git events (push, tag, PR) to build, test, and scan container images.  
- Parallel steps for unit tests, static analysis, and Docker image creation.  
- Integration with GitHub, GitLab, or Cloud Source Repositories.

### Artifact Registry Integration

- Use of Artifact Registry (Docker format) to securely store and manage container images.  
- Image versioning, lifecycle policies, and fine-grained IAM access controls.  
- Signed image verification for deployment integrity.

### GKE Deployment

- Kubernetes manifests or Kustomize/Helm used to deploy applications to GKE.  
- Cloud Build automatically triggers GKE rollout on successful image push.  
- Use of Workload Identity for secure access to GCP services from workloads.

### Security & Compliance

- Cloud Build steps with inline vulnerability scanning (using tools like Container Analysis or Trivy).  
- Secrets managed via Secret Manager and injected into build or runtime environments.  
- IAM roles scoped per service and environment with least-privilege principle.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Integration with Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging for build and runtime metrics.  
- Optional Prometheus/Grafana stack for application-level visibility on GKE.  
- Notifications via Slack, email, or Pub/Sub on build and deployment outcomes.

## Benefits

- Fully managed, serverless CI/CD pipeline with native GCP tools  
- Fast and secure container build and deploy lifecycle  
- Consistent infrastructure and application rollout across environments  
- Tight IAM integration and artifact traceability
