Delivers cloud-native endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities, combining real-time threat prevention, behavioral analytics, and incident investigation across endpoints, workloads, and identities.

CrowdStrike Falcon enables continuous monitoring of endpoint activity to detect, block, and respond to malware, ransomware, zero-day exploits, and advanced persistent threats (APTs). Its lightweight sensor and cloud-based analytics engine provide low-latency protection without impacting system performance.

This skillset includes configuring Falcon policies, tuning detection rules, managing prevention modes, and integrating threat intelligence feeds. Supports threat hunting via Falcon Insight, real-time IOC searches, and proactive investigations using telemetry data across endpoints and containers.

CrowdStrike’s API and SIEM integrations enable enriched event forwarding to platforms like Splunk, Sentinel, or Elastic, supporting centralized visibility and incident correlation. Role-based access, audit logging, and integration with identity systems like Azure AD contribute to strong governance and accountability.

Used in both security operations and compliance contexts, Falcon supports MITRE ATT&CK mapping, automated response playbooks, and regulatory requirements such as HIPAA, SOC 2, and PCI-DSS. It’s also leveraged for vulnerability management, asset discovery, and software inventory.

By providing unified, real-time visibility into endpoint activity, CrowdStrike Falcon enhances organizational resilience, reduces dwell time, and supports faster, intelligence-driven response to modern cyber threats.
