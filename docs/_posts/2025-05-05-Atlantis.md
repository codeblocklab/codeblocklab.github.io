Introduces pull requestâ€“driven infrastructure automation by bringing Terraform workflows into Git-based collaboration, enabling teams to plan, review, and apply infrastructure changes through standard code review processes.

Atlantis integrates directly with source control platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to trigger Terraform operations based on pull request events. When a change is proposed, Atlantis automatically runs terraform plan and posts the results back to the PR, allowing teams to review and approve changes before applying them with a simple comment.

This skillset enables GitOps-style infrastructure management by codifying approval workflows, enforcing policy gates, and maintaining full traceability of infrastructure changes. Supports both monolithic and modular Terraform architectures, including workspaces, remote backends, and Terragrunt-based setups.

Atlantis can be deployed securely inside Kubernetes or as a standalone service, with configurable access control, locking mechanisms, and environment segregation to prevent concurrent mutations. It integrates seamlessly with CI/CD tooling and secret managers to provide secure, repeatable automation pipelines.

Used across multi-environment infrastructures, Atlantis helps standardize change management, reduce risk, and align infrastructure delivery with software engineering best practices. It enhances collaboration by bringing visibility, automation, and governance into every infrastructure change.

By embedding Terraform directly into the pull request lifecycle, Atlantis strengthens infrastructure as code workflows and ensures infrastructure changes are as testable, reviewable, and auditable as application code.
