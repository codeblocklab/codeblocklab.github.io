Experienced in using Atlantis to automate Terraform workflows in a GitOps model. Proficient in setting up Atlantis to trigger plan and apply operations on pull requests, enabling infrastructure as code changes to be reviewed and approved before execution. Iâ€™ve configured custom workflows, managed multi-environment deployments, and used Git for version-controlled infrastructure updates. Atlantis helped enforce safe, auditable changes through peer-reviewed PRs. Also familiar with integrating Atlantis into GitHub and GitLab projects with proper IAM and backend configurations.
