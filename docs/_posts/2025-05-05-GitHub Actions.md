Experienced in using GitHub Actions to automate CI/CD workflows directly within GitHub repositories. Skilled in writing custom workflows using YAML to build, test, and deploy applications across environments. Iâ€™ve created reusable workflows and action templates for standardizing pipelines across multiple projects. Used secrets management, matrix builds, and conditional logic to support complex deployment scenarios. Also integrated GitHub Actions with cloud platforms and tools like Terraform, Docker, and Kubernetes.
