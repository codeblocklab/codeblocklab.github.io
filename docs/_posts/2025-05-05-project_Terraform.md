Multi-cloud IaC provisioning on AWS and GCP with Terraform/Terragrunt for Kubernetes, databases, and networking.

<!--more-->

We offer infrastructure provisioning across both AWS and GCP using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform and Terragrunt. This solution enables fast, secure, and consistent deployment of foundational cloud environments including Kubernetes clusters, managed databases, VPC peering, and NAT configurations in a multi-cloud setup.

## Scope of the Solution

### Cloud Resource Provisioning (GCP + AWS)

- Kubernetes Clusters  
  - GKE (GCP) and EKS (AWS) provisioning with autoscaling, node pools, and workload identity support.  
- Managed Databases
  - CloudSQL (GCP) and RDS (AWS) with high availability, private networking, and IAM integration.  
- Networking Components 
  - VPCs with private/public subnets, firewall rules/security groups, custom routes.  
  - VPC peering across regions and between cloud providers (where supported).  
  - NAT Gateways (AWS) and Cloud NAT (GCP) for secure outbound internet traffic.

### Infrastructure as Code (Terraform + Terragrunt)

- Reusable and modular Terraform configurations per cloud provider.  
- Terragrunt used for environment layering (dev/stage/prod), remote state management, and secrets isolation.  
- Version-controlled infrastructure with GitOps workflows (plan → review → apply).

### Security & Access Control

- IAM roles, service accounts, and policies defined via code for least privilege.  
- Private clusters with restricted access (authorized networks, endpoint shielding).  
- Secure secret injection via Secret Manager (GCP), AWS Secrets Manager, or Vault.

### CI/CD & Automation

- Git-based automation of Terraform plans/applies using Atlantis, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.  
- PR-based approval workflows with detailed change visibility.  
- Drift detection, state locking, and automated rollback strategies.

### Observability & Compliance

- Logging and auditing via AWS CloudTrail and GCP Audit Logs.  
- Resource tagging for cost attribution, compliance tracking, and lifecycle management.  
- Optional integration with monitoring and alerting stacks (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, Cloud Monitoring).

## Benefits

- Unified, cloud-agnostic approach to provisioning infrastructure  
- Scalable and secure environments aligned with best practices of both AWS and GCP  
- Declarative, automated workflows reducing manual error and deployment time  
- Full traceability, compliance, and multi-environment governance
