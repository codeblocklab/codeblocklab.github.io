Manages the deployment, configuration, security, and maintenance of Linux-based systems to ensure stable, secure, and high-performing infrastructure for applications and services.

Linux server administration covers a wide range of operational responsibilities, including package management, system initialization, kernel tuning, and file system configuration across distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, RHEL, and AlmaLinux.

This skillset includes user and permission management, process monitoring, log analysis, and service supervision using tools like systemd, journalctl, top, htop, and ps. Network configuration and diagnostics involve managing interfaces, firewalls (e.g., iptables, nftables, firewalld), DNS resolution, and troubleshooting connectivity issues with tools like netstat, ss, tcpdump, and traceroute.

Covers automation of routine tasks using shell scripting (e.g., Bash), cron jobs, and infrastructure tools such as Ansible or SSH orchestration. Also includes managing storage volumes, RAID, LVM, and ensuring backup and disaster recovery processes are in place.

Security practices involve patch management, SSH hardening, SELinux/AppArmor configuration, audit logging, fail2ban, and integration with centralized identity systems or directory services (e.g., LDAP, Kerberos).

By maintaining reliable, well-secured Linux environments, this skillset supports scalable application hosting, performance tuning, and incident resolution in both on-premises and cloud-native infrastructure.
