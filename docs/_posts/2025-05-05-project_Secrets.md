We provide secure and centralized secrets management for CI/CD workflows and Kubernetes-based automation. Our solution integrates secrets from cloud-native secret managers like AWS Secrets Manager and Google Secret Manager directly into pipelines, ensuring sensitive data is handled safely, auditable, and in compliance with best practices.

## Scope of the Solution

### Secure Secrets Integration
- Injection of secrets into CI/CD workflows (e.g., Argo Workflows, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) without exposing them in logs or code.  
- Dynamic fetching of secrets at runtime from AWS Secrets Manager or GCP Secret Manager.  
- Support for rotating credentials and secure secret referencing in YAML workflows or Helm charts.

### Kubernetes & Runtime Support
- Integration with Kubernetes-native secrets consumption mechanisms (via CSI drivers or sidecars).  
- Secure mounting of secrets into pods or containers as environment variables or files.  
- Role-based access to secrets via IAM (AWS/GCP) with fine-grained control per environment/team.

### Observability & Compliance
- Audit trails for secret access via cloud-native logging tools (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, GCP Audit Logs).  
- Automated scanning and alerting for hardcoded secrets in repositories using tools like Trivy or Gitleaks.  
- Optional integration with Vault for advanced secret workflows (e.g., short-lived credentials, dynamic DB passwords).

### Workflow Use Cases
- Use of secrets in build pipelines for accessing APIs, signing artifacts, and authenticating with external services.  
- Secrets-based gating for production deployments (e.g., token validation, signed approvals).  
- Cross-cloud secrets strategy in multi-cloud environments with centralized governance.

## Benefits
- Secure and compliant handling of credentials and tokens in automated workflows  
- Centralized secret management aligned with cloud-native practices  
- Reduced risk of secret leaks or misconfigurations  
- Scalable and reusable integration patterns across environments and teams
