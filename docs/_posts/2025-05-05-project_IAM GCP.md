GCP IAM provisioning based on Google Workspace groups for centralized, scalable access control.

<!--more-->

We implement identity and access management (IAM) provisioning in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using **Google Workspace groups** as the foundation for access control. This allows organizations to manage permissions centrally via groups, ensuring scalable, auditable, and compliant access across GCP projects and services.

## Scope of the Solution

### Group-Based IAM Architecture

- Definition of IAM bindings in GCP based on Google Workspace groups (e.g., `devops@example.com`, `developers@example.com`).  
- Centralized role assignment at the organization, folder, or project level.  
- Group membership management delegated to Google Workspace admins, not cloud operators.

### IAM Role Assignment via Terraform

- Use of Terraform to provision and manage IAM policies using `google_project_iam_member`, `binding`, or `policy`.  
- Version-controlled IAM configuration per environment and project.  
- Optional support for custom roles and fine-grained permission sets.

### Multi-Environment Support

- Separation of IAM roles across dev/stage/prod using folder/project structure or labels.  
- Environment-specific access (e.g., developers have read-only in prod, admin in dev).  
- Use of Terragrunt for scalable and DRY configuration across multiple projects.

### Compliance & Auditability

- Integration with Cloud Audit Logs to monitor access and permission changes.  
- Optional enforcement with IAM Conditions for time-bound or context-aware access.  
- Reviewable access policies via code and Git history (e.g., for SOC 2, ISO 27001).

## Benefits

- Centralized identity control using familiar Google Workspace group structures  
- Reduced IAM sprawl and simplified permission reviews  
- GitOps-friendly and fully auditable IAM configuration via Terraform  
- Scalable access model across multiple projects and environments
