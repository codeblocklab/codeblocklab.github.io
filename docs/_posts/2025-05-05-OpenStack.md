Provides an open-source cloud infrastructure platform for managing compute, storage, and networking resources through a modular, API-driven architecture—enabling private and hybrid cloud deployments at scale.

<!--more-->
OpenStack allows organizations to build and operate IaaS environments similar to public cloud providers, with full control over virtualized infrastructure. It includes core components such as Nova (compute), Neutron (networking), Cinder (block storage), Glance (image services), Keystone (identity), and Horizon (dashboard).

This skillset includes deploying and operating OpenStack environments using tools like DevStack, Kolla, TripleO, or custom Ansible automation. Covers configuration of hypervisors (KVM/QEMU), SDN integration, storage backends (Ceph, LVM, NFS), and tenant isolation.

Also includes managing identity and multi-tenancy through Keystone, configuring security groups, quotas, and RBAC, as well as implementing high availability and scalability across controller and compute nodes. Monitoring, metering, and billing are handled via components like Ceilometer, Gnocchi, and Telemetry.

OpenStack is used in enterprise, telecom, and research environments to power private clouds, NFV infrastructures, and edge computing platforms. Integrates with Kubernetes, OpenShift, and CI/CD pipelines for cloud-native and hybrid deployments.

By enabling open, flexible, and fully controlled cloud infrastructure, OpenStack allows organizations to modernize IT operations without vendor lock-in—supporting custom architectures, regulatory compliance, and infrastructure sovereignty.
