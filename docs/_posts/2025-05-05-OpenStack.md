Worked with OpenStack to build and manage private cloud environments. Used key services like Nova, Neutron, Cinder, and Keystone. Automated setup and updates using Heat templates and Ansible, with everything tracked in Git. Also experienced in setting up monitoring and dashboards with Horizon and Prometheus. Iâ€™ve deployed OpenStack in lab and production settings, focusing on stability and scalability. My experience also includes troubleshooting networking, authentication, and storage issues across multi-node deployments.
