Extends Terraform by providing tooling for managing infrastructure-as-code at scale—enabling better code reuse, environment isolation, dependency orchestration, and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) workflows.

Terragrunt acts as a thin wrapper around Terraform, allowing teams to manage complex infrastructure hierarchies by abstracting repetitive configurations and enforcing best practices. It simplifies multi-environment deployments (e.g., dev/staging/prod), remote state configuration, and backend consistency using a shared terragrunt.hcl structure.

This skillset includes designing infrastructure layouts using Terragrunt’s live vs. modules pattern, configuring dependencies between modules, handling variable injection, and leveraging before_hook and after_hook automation for pre/post-deployment logic.

Supports automated remote state management (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB, GCS, Azure Blob), partial and targeted deployments, and locking to prevent concurrent modifications. Terragrunt also enhances CI/CD integration by simplifying environment switching and pipeline logic for Terraform executions.

Commonly used in large-scale, multi-team cloud environments, Terragrunt enables infrastructure standardization and governance without sacrificing flexibility—helping to enforce naming conventions, policy compliance, and module versioning across environments.

By layering structure, automation, and reusability on top of Terraform, Terragrunt reduces complexity, improves collaboration, and accelerates infrastructure delivery at scale.
