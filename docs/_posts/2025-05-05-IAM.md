Establishes the foundation for secure access control by defining, enforcing, and auditing who can access what, when, and under which conditions across systems, applications, and cloud environments.

IAM encompasses user identity lifecycle management, role-based access control (RBAC), policy definition, authentication, authorization, and auditing. It ensures that only the right identities (users, services, devices) have access to the right resources, at the right time, and for the right reasons.

This skillset includes designing scalable IAM architectures across cloud platforms (e.g., AWS IAM, Azure AD, GCP IAM), implementing least-privilege principles, managing service accounts, and securing machine-to-machine authentication using tokens, certificates, or federation protocols (SAML, OIDC, OAuth2).

IAM integrates with directory services, HR systems, and identity providers (IdPs) to automate provisioning, deprovisioning, and access review workflows. Controls are enforced through policies, conditional access, and Just-In-Time access strategies, with full audit trails for compliance.

Supports identity governance functions such as access certification, entitlement mapping, and separation of duties. Often used alongside tools like Okta, Keycloak, HashiCorp Vault, and cloud-native IAM solutions to unify identity control across hybrid environments.

By centralizing identity and access decisions, IAM strengthens security posture, supports regulatory compliance, and enables secure collaboration across internal and external users at scale.
