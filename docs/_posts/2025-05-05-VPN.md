Establishes secure, encrypted tunnels over untrusted networks to enable private, authenticated communication between users, systems, and remote infrastructure.

VPNs are used to protect data in transit, enforce secure remote access, and extend private networks across distributed environments. They are essential for hybrid cloud, remote workforce enablement, and secure site-to-site connectivity.

This skillset includes configuring and managing VPN solutions such as IPSec, OpenVPN, WireGuard, and cloud-native VPNs (e.g., AWS Site-to-Site VPN, Azure VPN Gateway). Covers authentication methods (pre-shared keys, certificates, SAML), encryption algorithms, tunneling protocols, and routing strategies (split vs. full tunnel).

Also includes managing user access control, MFA integration, and policy enforcement for device posture and geo-restrictions. Operational practices involve log monitoring, tunnel health checks, and automation of provisioning using tools like Ansible, Terraform, or cloud SDKs.

VPN implementations are often integrated with firewalls, identity providers, and network segmentation strategies to support Zero Trust access models and regulatory compliance (e.g., HIPAA, PCI-DSS).

By securing communications across untrusted networks, VPNs enable safe access to internal systems, reduce exposure to man-in-the-middle attacks, and support secure connectivity for remote users and distributed infrastructure.
