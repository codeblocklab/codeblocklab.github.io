SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) is an auditing standard developed by the AICPA for technology and cloud service providers that handle sensitive data. It validates that internal controls and processes meet defined criteria for data protection and service reliability.

This skillset includes designing and implementing controls aligned with the SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria, developing and maintaining policies and procedures, and preparing audit-ready documentation across key domains: access control, change management, incident response, monitoring, and risk management.

Also covers performing readiness assessments, identifying control gaps, implementing remediation plans, and managing collaboration with external auditors for SOC 2 Type I or Type II reports. Integrates with cloud-native tooling, SIEM platforms, ticketing systems, and security dashboards for continuous evidence collection and reporting.

Supports automation of audit evidence through tools like Vanta, Drata, Tugboat Logic, or custom workflows embedded in DevSecOps pipelines. Includes employee onboarding/offboarding workflows, asset tracking, vulnerability management, and vendor risk assessment.

By achieving and maintaining SOC 2 compliance, organizations demonstrate commitment to security and trust—supporting sales enablement, reducing third-party risk concerns, and meeting contractual or regulatory obligations.
