We deliver a modular and reusable Infrastructure as Code (IaC) setup for provisioning AWS services including RDS, S3, Lambda, and API Gateway. Designed for flexibility and scalability, our solution allows teams to deploy backend services in a controlled, consistent, and automated manner using Terraform modules.

## Scope of the Solution

### Modular Terraform Architecture
- Creation of reusable Terraform modules for RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL), S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and REST/HTTP APIs with API Gateway.  
- Environment-aware configuration (dev/staging/prod) using Terragrunt or native workspaces.  
- Support for tagging, naming conventions, and parameter inheritance across modules.

### RDS (Relational Database Service)
- Provisioning of RDS instances with multi-AZ, automated backups, monitoring, and encryption.  
- Private subnet placement with controlled security groups and IAM access integration.  
- Optional Aurora support with failover and read replicas.

### S3 Buckets
- Creation of application-specific buckets with lifecycle policies, encryption, and access logging.  
- Fine-grained IAM roles and bucket policies for service and user access.  
- Integration with Lambda triggers or static website hosting.

### AWS Lambda
- Deployment of event-driven Lambda functions from source or pre-built artifacts.  
- Configuration of environment variables, IAM roles, timeout/memory settings, and concurrency.  
- Logging and monitoring via CloudWatch Logs and X-Ray (optional).

### API Gateway
- Setup of REST or HTTP APIs for exposing Lambda functions securely.  
- Route configuration, CORS, custom domain support, and throttling rules.  
- IAM, Cognito, or API key-based authentication.

### Automation & DevOps
- Terraform-based automation with Git-driven workflows (Atlantis, GitHub Actions, etc.).  
- State management using S3 + DynamoDB with versioning and locking.  
- Secure secrets injection using AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store.

## Benefits
- Modular, reusable infrastructure code aligned with AWS best practices  
- Secure and scalable setup for cloud-native backend services  
- Full automation of infrastructure deployment across environments  
- Easy onboarding for new projects with minimal duplication
