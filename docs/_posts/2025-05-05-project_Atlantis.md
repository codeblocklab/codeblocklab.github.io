GitOps-style Terraform automation with Atlantis for safe, auditable IaC changes via pull requests.

<!--more-->

We implement Atlantis to automate Terraform workflows directly from Git repositories. This enables GitOps-style infrastructure changes, where each pull request triggers a plan, and only approved changes are applied, ensuring auditability, collaboration, and safe delivery of infrastructure as code.

## Scope of the Solution

### Atlantis Deployment

- Containerized deployment of Atlantis in Kubernetes or as a standalone service.  
- Secure integration with Git providers (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Forgejo) via webhooks and access tokens.  
- Support for multi-repo and multi-environment configurations with per-project settings.

### Terraform Automation

- Automatic execution of `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` based on pull request comments.  
- Integration with remote state backends (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB, GCS, Azure Blob) and locking mechanisms.  
- Policy enforcement using pre/post hooks, Sentinel, or OPA if needed.

### GitOps Workflow Design

- Git-based change approvals: infrastructure changes are only applied after code review and PR merge.  
- Clear, comment-driven UX: `atlantis plan`, `atlantis apply`, `atlantis unlock`.  
- Status updates and logs posted directly in pull request conversations.

### Security & Access Control

- Least-privilege IAM for Terraform operations in AWS, GCP, or Azure.  
- Secrets (cloud credentials, tokens) injected securely using Kubernetes Secrets or Vault.  
- RBAC control over who can trigger and approve plans/applies.

### Observability & Audit

- Centralized logging of all Atlantis operations (plan/apply history).  
- Monitoring via Prometheus/Grafana and alerting on failed runs.  
- Optional integration with Slack or Teams for notifications.

## Benefits

- Automated, safe, and auditable Terraform operations via pull requests  
- Eliminates the need for engineers to run `terraform apply` locally  
- Encourages collaboration and compliance in infrastructure changes  
- Supports scaling infrastructure teams across multiple environments and projects
