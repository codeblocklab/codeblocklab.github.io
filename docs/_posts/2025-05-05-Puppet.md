Automates infrastructure configuration and management through declarative, model-driven workflowsâ€”ensuring consistency, compliance, and scalability across physical, virtual, and cloud environments.

Puppet enables infrastructure as code (IaC) by defining system state using its domain-specific language (DSL), allowing for centralized, version-controlled management of servers and services. It supports both agent-based and agentless architectures and integrates with popular CMDBs, cloud providers, and CI/CD pipelines.

This skillset includes writing and maintaining Puppet manifests and modules, managing environments with control repos, using Hiera for data abstraction, and applying configuration policies across nodes using role/profile patterns. Also covers orchestration via Puppet Bolt, task automation, and reporting with PuppetDB.

Supports configuration drift detection, audit trails, and enforcement of compliance baselines through continuous convergence. Puppet integrates with Git, r10k, and Forge modules for reuse and team collaboration, and offers fine-grained RBAC and node classification for complex environments.

Used in hybrid, multi-cloud, and on-premise infrastructures, Puppet ensures predictable provisioning, patching, service configuration, and application deployment across fleets of servers.

By codifying infrastructure intent and automating system state enforcement, Puppet reduces manual work, enhances operational stability, and improves compliance posture at scale.
