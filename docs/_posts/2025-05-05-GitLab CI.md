Delivers integrated continuous integration and deployment capabilities within the GitLab platform, enabling end-to-end automation of software delivery pipelines from commit to production.

GitLab CI allows teams to define CI/CD pipelines as code using .gitlab-ci.yml, supporting build, test, deploy, and release stages for applications, containers, and infrastructure. Pipelines are tightly integrated with merge requests, issue tracking, and Git-based workflows, ensuring seamless collaboration and traceability.

This skillset includes authoring modular pipeline jobs with stages, rules, conditionals, and artifacts. Supports matrix builds, caching strategies, parallel execution, and dependency chaining to optimize performance. Runners (shared or self-hosted) can be tailored to support Docker, shell, Kubernetes, or custom execution environments.

GitLab CI integrates with Kubernetes for deployment automation, with Helm, Kustomize, or raw manifests. Infrastructure provisioning can be handled using Terraform modules directly in pipelines with secure variable injection and approval gates.

Used for static code analysis, secret scanning, license compliance, container image building, and artifact management. Pipelines support environment-specific logic, dynamic environments, and manual gates for progressive delivery.

Security and governance features include pipeline-level permissions, audit logs, protected branches, and integration with GitLabâ€™s policy engine for compliance enforcement.

By embedding CI/CD directly into the Git platform, GitLab CI unifies code, automation, and deployment, reducing tool fragmentation and enabling faster, more secure, and more collaborative software delivery
