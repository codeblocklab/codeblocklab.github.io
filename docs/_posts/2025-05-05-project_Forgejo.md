Kubernetes-native CI/CD with Argo Workflows and Forgejo for scalable, declarative automation

<!--more-->

We implement CI/CD pipelines based on Argo Workflows integrated with Forgejo, an open-source Git service. This solution provides scalable, container-native automation that replaces traditional CI tools with Kubernetes-native workflows managed declaratively.

## Scope of the Solution

### CI/CD Architecture Design

- Implementation of Argo Workflows as a Kubernetes-native pipeline engine.  
- Definition of reusable workflow templates and DAG-based job orchestration.  
- Design of Git-based triggers and artifact management tailored to Forgejo repositories.

### Integration with Forgejo

- Webhook integration between Forgejo and Argo Workflows to trigger builds and deployments on push, PRs, or tag events.  
- Repository structure and GitOps-friendly conventions for pipeline definitions stored as code.  
- Secure authentication and access control between Forgejo and Kubernetes/Argo components.

### Pipeline Capabilities

- Support for multi-step CI pipelines: build, test, security scan, image build & push.  
- Environment-specific deployment pipelines (e.g., staging, production) with promotion logic.  
- Native container execution with sidecars, volume mounts, and caching for performance.

### Observability & Notifications

- Real-time monitoring of workflow executions through Argo UI and custom dashboards.  
- Integration with notification systems (Slack, email, etc.) for status updates and failure alerts.  
- Artifact tracking and persistent logs for audit and troubleshooting.

### Security & Compliance

- RBAC configuration in Kubernetes to isolate and secure pipeline execution.  
- Secrets management via external providers (e.g., HashiCorp Vault or Kubernetes Secrets).  
- Enforcement of code and pipeline integrity via signed commits and policy checks.

## Benefits

- Fully Kubernetes-native CI/CD with no external runners  
- Tight integration with Forgejo for seamless GitOps workflows  
- Highly customizable and scalable pipelines for modern cloud-native development  
- Declarative pipelines as code, enabling version control and auditability
