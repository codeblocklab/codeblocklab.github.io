A Kubernetes-native workflow engine designed for orchestrating complex, container-based pipelines using declarative YAML specifications. Ideal for automating CI/CD processes, data pipelines, and machine learning workflows within scalable, cloud-native environments.

With Argo Workflows, teams can define DAG- or step-based workflows as Kubernetes CRDs, enabling repeatable and auditable automation that runs entirely within the cluster. Each step is executed in an isolated container, allowing workflows to scale efficiently and leverage existing container-based tooling.

The skillset includes workflow templating, parameterization, artifact passing, conditional execution, and retries, supporting robust and modular pipeline design. Argo integrates with volume mounts, secrets, service accounts, and custom resources to ensure workflows operate securely and within policy boundaries.

Supports advanced use cases such as dynamic workflow generation, fan-in/fan-out patterns, scheduled executions, and parallel task orchestration. Integrates natively with Argo Events for event-driven triggers, and with Argo CD or GitOps pipelines to enable end-to-end automation from commit to deployment.

Includes workflow archival, real-time UI monitoring, and metadata storage for traceability and debugging. RBAC support, workflow policies, and auditability features allow Argo Workflows to operate in compliance-critical environments.

By codifying pipelines as Kubernetes resources, Argo Workflows enables high-velocity, reproducible automation at scaleâ€”turning Kubernetes into a powerful, native automation engine for modern engineering workflows.
