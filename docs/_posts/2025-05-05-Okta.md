Delivers cloud-based identity and access management by centralizing authentication, authorization, and user lifecycle operations across applications, infrastructure, and devices.

Okta provides a highly scalable identity platform that supports single sign-on (SSO), multi-factor authentication (MFA), lifecycle management, and adaptive access controls. It integrates with thousands of applications via prebuilt connectors and supports industry-standard protocols such as SAML, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect.

This skillset includes configuring identity providers and service providers, managing users and groups, setting up SCIM-based provisioning, and enforcing conditional access policies based on device posture, location, or risk signals.

Used in both workforce and customer identity scenarios, Okta supports Just-In-Time provisioning, self-service account recovery, and directory integration with on-prem Active Directory or LDAP. It also plays a key role in Zero Trust architectures by enabling context-aware authentication and continuous access evaluation.

Okta integrates with DevOps workflows via APIs, SDKs, and Terraform providers, and supports compliance and governance through audit trails, access reviews, and granular role-based access control (RBAC).

By consolidating identity across environments, Okta improves user experience, strengthens security posture, and enables scalable, policy-driven access for modern cloud-first organizations.
