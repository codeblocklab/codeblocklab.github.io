Streamlines authentication by allowing users to access multiple applications and systems with a single set of credentials—enhancing user experience while improving access control and security.

SSO reduces password sprawl and login friction by centralizing identity verification through trusted identity providers (IdPs) using protocols such as SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect (OIDC). It enables seamless integration between internal systems, SaaS platforms, and federated identity environments.

This skillset includes configuring and managing SSO flows across cloud and on-prem applications, integrating with providers like Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace, Keycloak, or Ping Identity, and managing service provider (SP) and IdP trust relationships.

Supports user provisioning and attribute mapping, secure token handling, session timeout policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA) enforcement, and conditional access logic. Also involves securing authentication endpoints, validating assertions, and troubleshooting identity federation issues.

SSO is commonly integrated with role-based access control (RBAC), identity governance platforms, and logging systems to ensure auditability and least-privilege enforcement across user journeys.

By centralizing authentication, SSO improves security hygiene, simplifies access management, and reduces administrative overhead—supporting both productivity and compliance in modern, multi-application environments.
