Implements technical controls and configuration standards that reduce attack surface, enforce least privilege, and strengthen the baseline security posture of systems, applications, and networks.

Security hardening applies to operating systems, containers, cloud services, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure componentsâ€”ensuring systems are resilient against common exploits, misconfigurations, and unauthorized access.

This skillset includes applying hardening benchmarks (e.g., CIS, STIG), disabling unused services and ports, enforcing strong authentication and encryption protocols, and securing default configurations across Linux, Windows, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms.

Covers filesystem permissions, patch management, kernel parameter tuning (e.g., sysctl), SSH hardening, secure boot configurations, and service isolation via container security or sandboxing techniques. Often involves integrating tools like Ansible, Chef, or custom scripts for consistent, automated enforcement.

In cloud environments, security hardening practices extend to IAM roles, network security groups, storage encryption, logging, and workload identity isolation. Includes policy enforcement using tools like AWS Config, Azure Policy, or OPA.

Hardening is validated through vulnerability scans, compliance checks, penetration tests, and continuous monitoring with SIEM or CSPM tools to detect drift or regressions.

By applying rigorous security hardening, organizations proactively defend against threats, reduce configuration-related risks, and create a secure foundation for compliant, production-grade systems.
