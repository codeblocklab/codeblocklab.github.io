Combines infrastructure monitoring, application performance management (APM), log analytics, and security observability into a unified platform for full-stack visibility across modern cloud environments.

Datadog collects and correlates metrics, traces, logs, and events in real time, enabling proactive detection of performance issues, outages, and security threats. It supports integration with hundreds of technologies—cloud providers, container platforms, databases, and CI/CD pipelines—making it highly adaptable across heterogeneous environments.

This skillset includes configuring dashboards, monitors, SLOs, anomaly detection, and alerting strategies tailored to both technical and business requirements. Supports distributed tracing and service dependency mapping for microservice architectures, as well as profiling and real-user monitoring (RUM) for end-to-end performance analysis.

Log management capabilities enable centralization, parsing, enrichment, and retention policies for compliance and observability. Datadog also integrates with incident response tools, ticketing systems, and chat platforms for streamlined operations and collaboration.

Used in DevOps, SRE, and security contexts, Datadog supports security monitoring (Cloud SIEM), compliance posture tracking, and threat detection through unified observability data. Custom tagging and RBAC allow fine-grained visibility by team, service, or environment.

By consolidating observability across infrastructure, applications, and security, Datadog empowers teams to detect problems faster, reduce MTTR, and improve system reliability at scale.
