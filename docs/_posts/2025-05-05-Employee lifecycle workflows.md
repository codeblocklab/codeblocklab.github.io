AWS expert with deep, hands-on experience across the entire AWS ecosystem designing scalable, secure, and cost-optimized environments aligned with best practices.

Experienced in designing and implementing automated employee onboarding and offboarding processes across IT systems. Integrated directory services (e.g., Okta, Azure AD) with provisioning tools to assign roles, access, and resources based on job functions. Iâ€™ve worked with HRIS integrations and SCIM to synchronize user accounts and ensure timely deactivation. Used Git-based workflows and approval systems to document changes. These practices help maintain compliance and reduce risk tied to user lifecycle events.
