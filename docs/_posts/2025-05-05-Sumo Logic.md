Delivers cloud-native log management, metrics analytics, and security insights through a unified platform—enabling real-time observability, threat detection, and operational intelligence across modern infrastructure and applications.

Sumo Logic ingests structured and unstructured data from cloud services, containers, on-prem systems, and SaaS platforms to support monitoring, troubleshooting, and compliance. It provides scalable ingestion, retention, and querying of telemetry data with support for dynamic fields, parsing, and pattern recognition.

This skillset includes configuring data collection via collectors and sources (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS, Fluentd), writing queries using the Sumo Logic Search Query Language, creating visual dashboards, and setting up scheduled searches and alerts for incident response.

Also includes implementation of security analytics use cases using Sumo Logic Cloud SIEM and SOAR capabilities—mapping detections to MITRE ATT&CK, managing threat intel feeds, and automating response actions across systems.

Supports DevOps and SRE practices through integration with CI/CD tools, anomaly detection, log-to-metrics conversion, and root cause analysis for distributed systems. Native support for compliance monitoring (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2) helps organizations meet regulatory requirements efficiently.

By centralizing observability and security in a single SaaS platform, Sumo Logic enables proactive monitoring, faster troubleshooting, and data-driven decision-making across both infrastructure and application stacks.
