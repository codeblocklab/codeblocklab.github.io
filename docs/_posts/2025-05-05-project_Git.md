Self-hosted GitOps CI/CD with Forgejo and Argo Events for secure, event-driven Kubernetes automation.

<!--more-->

This project aims to implement a fully self-hosted, GitOps-ready CI/CD platform leveraging Forgejo (Gitea fork) and Argo Events, to support secure, scalable, and event-driven automation within a Kubernetes-native environment.

The platform is designed for teams that require full control over their infrastructure, source code, and deployment pipelines â€” without relying on SaaS solutions like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
