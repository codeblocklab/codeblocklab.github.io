Secures data in transit by encrypting communication between clients and servers, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity across networks and applications.

TLS is the foundational protocol for secure web, API, and service communication. It underpins HTTPS, email encryption (e.g., SMTPS, IMAPS), VPN tunnels, and internal service-to-service traffic across modern architectures, including microservices and cloud-native environments.

This skillset includes configuring and managing TLS certificates (self-signed or issued by public/internal certificate authorities), implementing secure ciphers and protocols, and ensuring proper key rotation, certificate renewal, and chain validation. Also includes hardening TLS configurations on web servers (e.g., NGINX, Apache), reverse proxies, and load balancers.

Involves working with tools like OpenSSL, Certbot, HashiCorp Vault, AWS ACM, Let's Encrypt, and Kubernetes cert-manager. Supports integration with identity and PKI systems to automate certificate issuance and enforce mTLS (mutual TLS) for client-server authentication.

TLS management also includes validating compliance with industry standards (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA), enforcing HSTS policies, and conducting periodic vulnerability assessments for weak ciphers, expired certs, or protocol downgrades.

By securing transport-layer communications, TLS protects sensitive data from interception and tampering, serving as a critical layer in the defense-in-depth strategy for any modern IT environment.
