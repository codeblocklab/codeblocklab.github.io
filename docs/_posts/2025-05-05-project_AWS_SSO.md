Centralized AWS access with IAM Identity Center (SSO) and IdP integration for federated, role-based access

<!--more-->

We implement centralized user access control in AWS using **IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO)**. This solution enables seamless integration with identity providers (e.g., Azure AD, Google Workspace, Okta) and allows for federated, role-based access across multiple AWS accounts and applications.

## Scope of the Solution

### Identity Provider Integration
- Configuration of AWS IAM Identity Center with external IdPs via SAML or OIDC.  
- Mapping of user attributes and group memberships to AWS roles.  
- Support for Just-In-Time (JIT) user provisioning and SCIM-based group sync.

### Account & Role Management
- Centralized permission sets mapped to AWS accounts and organizational units (OUs).  
- Fine-grained IAM role definitions aligned with the principle of least privilege.  
- Automated assignment of access based on user roles or teams.

### User Experience
- Single Sign-On (SSO) portal for accessing AWS accounts, CLI profiles, and web applications.  
- CLI and SDK access configuration using AWS SSO credentials.  
- Self-service access requests and group-based permission management.

### Security & Compliance
- MFA enforcement, session timeouts, and access audit logs.  
- Integration with AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config for traceability.  
- Role lifecycle and access reviews to support compliance frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2).

### Automation & Governance
- Infrastructure as Code support for IAM Identity Center via Terraform.  
- Automated provisioning of permission sets and assignments using Terraform modules.  
- Policy-as-code integrations with tools like OPA or AWS SCPs for guardrails.

## Benefits
- Centralized, scalable access management across AWS environments  
- Reduced administrative overhead through identity federation and group-based access  
- Improved security posture and compliance with audit-ready controls  
- Seamless user experience with SSO across AWS accounts and services

## Technologies Used
- AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO)  
- AWS Organizations  
- External IdPs (Azure AD, Okta, Google Workspace)  
- Terraform  
- AWS CloudTrail / AWS Config  
- OPA / AWS Service Control Policies (SCP)
