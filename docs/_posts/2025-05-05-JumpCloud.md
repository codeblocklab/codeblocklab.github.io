Unifies identity, device, and access management into a single cloud directory platform—enabling secure, centralized control over user authentication, authorization, and endpoint policy enforcement across heterogeneous environments.

JumpCloud serves as a cloud-native alternative to traditional Active Directory, supporting cross-platform user and system management for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It integrates identity and access control with device management, directory services, RADIUS, LDAP, SSO (SAML), and cloud application provisioning.

This skillset includes configuring directory structures, managing user lifecycles, enforcing conditional access policies, and integrating with identity providers, HR systems, and SaaS platforms. Supports multi-factor authentication (MFA), Just-In-Time access, and Zero Trust security models across cloud and on-prem infrastructure.

Endpoint management includes deploying and enforcing OS policies, scripting tasks, monitoring system health, and ensuring compliance through automated MDM-like controls—all managed through a centralized web interface or API.

JumpCloud also supports SCIM provisioning, identity federation, and detailed logging for auditing and compliance purposes. It enables consistent policy enforcement, credential rotation, and secure remote access for distributed teams and hybrid workforces.

By consolidating identity and device management, JumpCloud streamlines IT operations, strengthens security posture, and enables scalable, policy-driven access control across the modern enterprise.
