Enables real-time log aggregation, processing, and analysis across distributed systems, offering centralized visibility into application behavior, system health, and security events.

Graylog collects structured and unstructured log data from servers, containers, applications, and network devices using protocols such as Syslog, GELF, and Beats. Its pipeline processing engine supports parsing, transformation, and enrichment of log streams to extract relevant operational and security insights.

This skillset includes configuring inputs, defining extractors and pipeline rules, managing alert conditions, and creating custom dashboards for real-time observability. Graylog supports fine-grained access control, log retention strategies, and integration with compliance and auditing workflows.

Often used for incident investigation, performance monitoring, and threat detection, Graylog offers powerful querying, correlation, and filtering capabilities to help teams quickly identify root causes and abnormal behavior.

Scalable across high-volume environments, Graylog integrates with Elasticsearch for storage and retrieval, and supports external system integration via APIs, webhooks, and message queues.

By unifying logs into a centralized, actionable platform, Graylog enhances system reliability, improves response times, and supports compliance and security operations with greater efficiency.
