Provides centralized identity and access management across cloud and on-premises environments, enabling secure authentication, authorization, and policy enforcement for users, applications, and services.

Azure AD supports directory services, single sign-on (SSO), multifactor authentication (MFA), and conditional access, making it a critical component of enterprise security and compliance strategy. It enables integration with Microsoft 365, SaaS platforms, custom applications, and hybrid infrastructure using protocols like SAML, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect.

This skillset includes managing user and group lifecycles, role-based access control (RBAC), enterprise app registrations, and service principals. Supports federated identity via on-prem AD, B2B collaboration, and B2C scenarios, enabling secure access across organizational boundaries.

Policy management covers conditional access rules, risk-based sign-in controls, and identity protection measures to detect and respond to suspicious activity. Integration with Microsoft Defender, Entra, and logging tools ensures visibility and compliance across identity operations.

Azure AD also powers Just-In-Time access, privileged identity management (PIM), and seamless integration with CI/CD platforms for secure DevOps practices. Through automated provisioning (SCIM), audit logs, and access reviews, it enforces governance at scale.

By centralizing identity across the organization, Azure AD improves security posture, simplifies access control, and supports scalable, policy-driven authentication for modern enterprise environments.
