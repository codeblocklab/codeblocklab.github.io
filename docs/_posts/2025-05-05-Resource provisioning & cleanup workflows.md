Automate the lifecycle management of infrastructure and platform resourcesâ€”ensuring efficient allocation, timely deprovisioning, and cost control across dynamic, cloud-native environments.

<!--more-->
Provisioning workflows handle the creation of compute, storage, networking, and platform resources across cloud (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP), Kubernetes, and on-prem environments. Cleanup workflows ensure unused or expired resources are properly decommissioned to prevent waste, reduce attack surface, and maintain compliance.

This skillset includes designing infrastructure-as-code (IaC) pipelines with tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or CloudFormation, orchestrating workflows with CI/CD systems or tools like Argo Workflows, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins. Covers tagging strategies, environment scoping (e.g., dev, staging, prod), and approval gates for controlled provisioning.

Cleanup logic may include TTL (time-to-live) automation, orphaned resource detection, scheduled teardown jobs, or event-based triggers via serverless functions or tools like Cloud Custodian and AWS Lambda. Integration with cost monitoring and usage analytics helps target inefficiencies and enforce policy.

Supports governance through identity-aware provisioning, RBAC, audit logging, and integration with ticketing or approval workflows (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira). Resource lifecycle automation improves developer velocity while ensuring that environments remain secure, consistent, and cost-effective.

By automating both provisioning and cleanup, teams reduce manual overhead, improve infrastructure hygiene, and enable self-service environments with guardrails in place.
