Experienced in designing and automating resource provisioning workflows that align with team needs, tagging policies, and budget controls. Skilled in implementing lifecycle automation to clean up unused or temporary resources, reducing waste and enforcing security best practices. Iâ€™ve built automated cleanup jobs for cloud storage, VMs, and Kubernetes namespaces, often triggered from Git-based workflows or scheduled tasks. Documentation and scripts are versioned in Git for review and traceability.
