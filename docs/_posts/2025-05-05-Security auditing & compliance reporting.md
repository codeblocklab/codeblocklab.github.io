Evaluates systems, processes, and controls to identify security gaps, verify compliance, and ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of digital assets across infrastructure and applications.

Security auditing involves systematic review of configurations, access controls, logging, network activity, and policy enforcement across cloud, on-prem, and hybrid environments. It supports both internal risk management and external compliance obligations (e.g., ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, HIPAA).

This skillset includes performing technical audits of systems (e.g., Linux, Windows, cloud services), reviewing IAM configurations, detecting misconfigurations, analyzing logs for anomalies, and validating security controls against established baselines or benchmarks (e.g., CIS, NIST).

Also covers use of automated tools such as OpenSCAP, Lynis, Nessus, ScoutSuite, or custom scripts to assess infrastructure posture. Findings are typically mapped to control frameworks and translated into risk reports, remediation plans, or compliance documentation.

Auditing workflows often integrate with SIEM platforms, vulnerability management systems, and asset inventories to provide continuous assessment and real-time visibility. Documentation includes audit trails, control testing evidence, and remediation tracking.

By enforcing accountability and validating security hygiene, security auditing reduces risk exposure, ensures regulatory alignment, and strengthens an organizationâ€™s ability to detect, prevent, and respond to threats.
