Proficient in implementing Privileged Access Management solutions to control and monitor access to sensitive systems and administrative accounts. Experienced in setting up just-in-time access, session recording, approval workflows, and credential vaulting. Iâ€™ve worked with PAM tools and integrated them into hybrid and cloud environments, reducing risk from over-privileged accounts. Access policies are managed via Git-based workflows when supported. Also skilled in auditing and reporting privileged activity as part of compliance requirements.
