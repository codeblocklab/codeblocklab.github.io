Secures, monitors, and controls access to critical systems and resources by enforcing strict governance over privileged accounts, credentials, and administrative actions across IT environments.

PAM solutions protect against insider threats, credential abuse, and lateral movement by limiting the scope, duration, and visibility of privileged access. This includes session recording, credential vaulting, Just-In-Time (JIT) elevation, and approval workflows for high-risk operations.

This skillset includes implementing PAM platforms (e.g., CyberArk, BeyondTrust, Delinea, HashiCorp Vault), onboarding accounts and systems, defining access policies, and integrating with identity providers (e.g., LDAP, Azure AD, Okta) for federated authentication. Also includes establishing time-bound access, break-glass procedures, and behavioral monitoring.

Supports compliance with regulatory frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST, PCI-DSS, and SOC 2 through access audit logs, session forensics, and enforcement of least-privilege principles. PAM systems often integrate with SIEMs, ITSM tools, and DevOps pipelines to ensure consistent enforcement across operational workflows.

Covers both human and non-human identities, including securing service accounts, SSH keys, API tokens, and secrets used by applications and automation tools. PAM also enables segmentation of high-risk environments such as domain controllers, production databases, and critical infrastructure.

By controlling and auditing privileged access, PAM strengthens organizational security posture, limits breach impact, and supports accountability and compliance across the entire IT landscape.
