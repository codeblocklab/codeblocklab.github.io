Orchestrates containerized workloads and services across clusters with declarative automation, scaling, and self-healing capabilitiesâ€”forming the backbone of modern cloud-native infrastructure.

Kubernetes manages the lifecycle of applications and infrastructure using a control plane and extensible APIs. It supports scheduling, service discovery, rolling deployments, auto-scaling, and resource optimization across distributed environments.

This skillset includes designing and managing workloads using Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, and Jobs; building configuration with ConfigMaps and Secrets; and defining robust service architectures using Ingress, Services, and NetworkPolicies.

Covers cluster provisioning and operations via tools like kubeadm, kops, eksctl, or Terraform, as well as securing clusters with RBAC, PodSecurity standards, and certificate management. Also includes monitoring and logging integrations using Prometheus, Grafana, Fluent Bit, and OpenTelemetry.

Kubernetes is extended through custom resources (CRDs), controllers, operators, and admission webhooks to automate complex infrastructure behaviors and integrate with external systems. Helm is commonly used for packaging and managing application deployments.

Integrated with CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes supports GitOps workflows, progressive delivery strategies (e.g., canary, blue-green), and hybrid or multi-cloud application portability.

By abstracting infrastructure complexity and enabling declarative operations, Kubernetes improves scalability, reliability, and velocity of application delivery in dynamic, cloud-native environments.
