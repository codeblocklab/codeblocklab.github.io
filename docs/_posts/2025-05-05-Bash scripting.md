Experienced in writing Bash scripts to automate system administration tasks, deployment routines, and development workflows. Skilled in handling file operations, conditionals, loops, and integrating with CLI tools across Linux-based environments. Iâ€™ve created scripts for provisioning servers, parsing logs, managing backups, and integrating with CI/CD pipelines. Comfortable using Bash in cloud-init scripts, cron jobs, and during container or VM lifecycle management. Scripts are version-controlled via Git for traceability and reuse across projects.
