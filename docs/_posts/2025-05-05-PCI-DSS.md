Defines a comprehensive set of security standards for protecting cardholder data and ensuring secure handling of payment information across systems that process, store, or transmit credit card data.

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) mandates technical, administrative, and physical controls to safeguard sensitive data. It applies to merchants, service providers, and any entities involved in payment processing, regardless of size or transaction volume.

This skillset includes interpreting and implementing the 12 core PCI requirements across areas such as network security, access control, encryption, vulnerability management, logging, and incident response. Involves designing and maintaining compliant system architectures, segmenting cardholder data environments (CDE), and documenting policies and procedures.

Supports audit readiness through evidence collection, control mapping, gap assessments, and working with Qualified Security Assessors (QSAs). Integrates with security tooling (e.g., SIEMs, WAFs, DLP, vulnerability scanners) to enforce continuous compliance and detect deviations in real time.

Covers cloud and hybrid PCI compliance using native controls from providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP, including tokenization, key management, and infrastructure segmentation. Also supports DevSecOps integration to automate control checks in CI/CD pipelines and reduce compliance drift.

By aligning with PCI-DSS, organizations reduce the risk of data breaches, avoid regulatory penalties, and build trust with customers by demonstrating secure and responsible handling of payment data.
