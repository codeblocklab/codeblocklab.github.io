Delivers powerful, extensible visualization and dashboarding capabilities for observability data—enabling real-time insights into infrastructure, applications, and business metrics across diverse data sources.

Grafana allows teams to create dynamic, interactive dashboards by connecting to time-series databases and monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Loki, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and more. Its plugin architecture supports a wide range of backends, visualizations, and alerting integrations.

This skillset includes building and organizing dashboards, templating with variables, managing folder permissions, and using annotations for event correlation. Supports advanced queries, transformation pipelines, and data linking to provide actionable insights tailored to developers, SREs, and business stakeholders.

Grafana’s alerting engine allows threshold-based and anomaly detection alerts to be routed to incident response platforms like PagerDuty, Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Opsgenie. It also supports synthetic monitoring, availability checks, and service health overviews through Grafana Cloud or self-hosted probes.

Often used alongside Prometheus and Loki in a full observability stack (Grafana Labs stack), Grafana helps correlate metrics, logs, and traces to accelerate root cause analysis and incident resolution.

By providing a centralized, flexible visualization layer, Grafana enhances observability, improves operational awareness, and enables data-driven decision-making across engineering and operations teams.
