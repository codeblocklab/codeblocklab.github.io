Provides event-driven automation for Kubernetes by enabling the definition and handling of complex event-based workflows. Integrates external and internal event sources with Kubernetes-native workloads to trigger pipelines, jobs, or infrastructure operations in real time.

With Argo Events, teams can create declarative, version-controlled event-driven architectures using Kubernetes CRDs. It connects various sources—such as webhooks, Kafka, SQS, cron schedules, GitHub events, or custom HTTP triggers—to downstream actions like Argo Workflows, Argo CD, or Kubernetes jobs.

This skillset enables decoupling automation logic from application code, promoting modularity and observability across CI/CD systems and operational processes. EventSources, Sensors, and Triggers are composed to define reliable, auditable execution paths in response to infrastructure or application changes.

Argo Events supports scalable and fault-tolerant delivery of events with built-in retries, event logging, and dead letter queues. It integrates seamlessly with Kubernetes-native tools and GitOps practices, allowing event-driven automation to be fully managed, audited, and versioned within source control.

Used in real-time deployment workflows, autoscaling strategies, infrastructure reconciliation, and system monitoring, Argo Events provides the foundation for reactive, intelligent automation across modern cloud-native platforms.
