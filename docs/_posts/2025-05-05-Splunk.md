Enables real-time data aggregation, search, analysis, and visualization across machine-generated logs and telemetryâ€”powering operational intelligence, security monitoring, and observability at scale.

Splunk collects and indexes data from diverse sources including applications, infrastructure, network devices, and cloud platforms, transforming unstructured logs into actionable insights. It supports large-scale ingestion, powerful search language (SPL), and interactive dashboards for visibility across environments.

This skillset includes configuring data inputs, setting up indexers and forwarders, writing SPL queries, and designing custom dashboards and reports for IT operations, DevOps, and security use cases. Also covers implementing alerts, scheduled searches, field extractions, and knowledge objects to structure and enrich incoming data.

Splunk is widely used in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) for threat detection, investigation, and response. Integration with SIEM, SOAR, and threat intel feeds enables correlation of events and automated response actions.

Supports compliance reporting (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA), infrastructure monitoring, and business analytics. Can be deployed on-premises or as Splunk Cloud, with role-based access controls, data retention policies, and scalable architecture to meet enterprise requirements.

By centralizing and contextualizing log and telemetry data, Splunk helps organizations reduce MTTR, improve situational awareness, and drive proactive, data-driven decision-making across teams.
