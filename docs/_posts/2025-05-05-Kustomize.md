Enables template-free, declarative configuration management for Kubernetes by layering and customizing YAML manifests without duplication or Helm-style templating.

<!--more-->

Kustomize allows teams to manage Kubernetes resource definitions in a scalable and maintainable way by separating base configurations from environment-specific overlays. It supports patching, variable substitution, resource composition, and configuration reuse through a native, Kubernetes-integrated toolchain.

This skillset includes structuring configuration hierarchies with kustomization.yaml, applying strategic merge and JSON6902 patches, and managing resource customization for multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod). Supports secret and config generation, common labels/annotations, and transformer plugins.

Often used in GitOps workflows alongside Argo CD or Flux, Kustomize simplifies environment promotion and drift detection without introducing a templating language or additional abstraction layers. It integrates cleanly with CI/CD pipelines, allowing declarative deployments through Git-managed manifests.

Kustomize is also leveraged in multi-tenant or multi-cluster deployments, where consistent configuration patterns and isolation are critical. It supports extension via plugins and hooks for integrating with policy engines or custom validation tools.

By enabling flexible, template-free configuration management, Kustomize reduces complexity, enforces consistency, and enhances maintainability in Kubernetes application and infrastructure delivery.
