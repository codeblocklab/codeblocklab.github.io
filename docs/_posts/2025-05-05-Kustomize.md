Proficient in using Kustomize to manage Kubernetes configurations across multiple environments without duplicating YAML files. Experienced in layering resources, patches, and overlays for flexible, scalable deployments. Iâ€™ve used Kustomize in GitOps workflows with ArgoCD and integrated it into CI/CD pipelines. Also familiar with managing secrets and config maps cleanly within Kustomize projects. Worked on simplifying infrastructure deployment while keeping environment-specific customizations manageable.
