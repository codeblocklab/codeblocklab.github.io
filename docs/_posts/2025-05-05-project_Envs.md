Isolated dev, staging and prod environments on AWS with Terraform/Terragrunt for safe, GitOps-ready deployments

<!--more-->

We implement isolated and independently managed **staging** and **production** environments on AWS using Terraform and Terragrunt. This setup enables teams to test infrastructure and application changes in a safe, production-like environment before promotion, following GitOps and DevSecOps best practices.

## Scope of the Solution

### Environment Isolation

- Separate AWS accounts or VPCs for staging and production environments.  
- Independent Terraform state files and workspaces per environment.  
- Environment-specific configurations for resource sizing, scaling, and security.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- Modular Terraform codebase reused across environments.  
- Terragrunt manages environment-specific inputs, backends (e.g., S3 + DynamoDB), and secrets.  
- Directory structure supports clear separation and promotion workflows (`/live/staging`, `/live/prod`).

### Resource Provisioning

- VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, IAM, and other services provisioned with differing configurations per stage.  
- Optional use of feature flags or conditional logic in Terraform for environment-specific variations.  
- CI/CD pipelines deploy infrastructure changes with PR-based approval and automated validation.

### Security & Compliance

- Least-privilege IAM roles scoped per environment.  
- Secure state locking, encryption, and access control using AWS-native tools.  
- Audit-ready logging via AWS CloudTrail and Config Rules per environment.

### Promotion Strategy

- Git-based workflows to promote changes from staging to production after successful tests.  
- Manual or automated change promotion via CI/CD tools (e.g., Atlantis, GitHub Actions).  
- Rollback support with versioned state and infrastructure diffs.

## Benefits

- Reduced risk of production incidents with safe, tested changes  
- Clear separation of responsibilities and access controls  
- Improved compliance and traceability with environment-specific auditing  
- Reusable IaC architecture for consistent multi-environment provisioning
