Provides open-source identity and access management for modern applications and services, supporting authentication, authorization, and federation through industry-standard protocols.

Keycloak enables centralized user management, single sign-on (SSO), and role-based access control (RBAC) across web, mobile, and API-based applications. It supports SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and OAuth 2.0 for integrating with internal systems and third-party identity providers.

This skillset includes configuring realms, clients, identity providers, and user federation with external directories such as LDAP or Active Directory. Also involves setting up fine-grained roles, groups, and access policies, along with securing applications using Keycloak adapters or reverse proxy integrations.

Supports features like multi-factor authentication (MFA), custom login themes, password policies, and session control. Keycloak's extensibility allows for custom authenticators, user workflows, and SPI (Service Provider Interface) extensions tailored to enterprise needs.

Used in both cloud-native and legacy environments, Keycloak helps standardize access control, streamline user provisioning, and enforce security policies across distributed systems. Integration with Kubernetes, microservices, and API gateways enables secure service-to-service communication.

By offering a flexible, standards-compliant IAM solution, Keycloak enables organizations to implement secure, scalable identity management while maintaining full control over deployment and customization.
