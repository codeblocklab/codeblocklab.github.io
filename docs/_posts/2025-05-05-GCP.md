I bring extensive experience across the Google Cloud Platform, where I architect and maintain cloud environments built for scale, performance, and operational resilience.

My work spans a wide range of GCP services including Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, and GKE. I use Terraform and Deployment Manager to provision infrastructure in a structured, repeatable manner, and integrate continuous delivery pipelines using Cloud Build, GitHub Actions, and related tools to streamline deployments.

I’ve supported a variety of projects—from containerized microservices running on Kubernetes to hybrid environments connected via Cloud VPN and Interconnect. I design secure network topologies using Shared VPCs, custom IAM roles, and organization policies, ensuring compliance and isolation across multiple GCP projects and environments.

My cloud implementations are grounded in Google’s best practices, focusing on cost governance, identity and access management, observability, and automation. I actively apply principles from the Google Cloud Architecture Framework to guide architectural decisions that promote reliability, security, and scalability from day one.

Beyond infrastructure, I collaborate closely with developers, SREs, and security teams to align cloud solutions with product and compliance goals. I’ve worked on both greenfield and cloud migration projects, and I’m experienced in multi-project setups using GCP Organizations, folders, and billing management for long-term growth and maintainability.

Whether optimizing existing deployments or building platforms from scratch, I focus on delivering clean, efficient, and production-ready cloud solutions.
